The citation of Nakumar about Lev Manovich talking about media is to be understood more deeply. He talks about race and discrimination within this topic and how the media has a lot to do with this and has changed so much within the years. Individuals that are part of minority groups like asian americans, african americans, and latinos are more part of the media today then there has ever been. From what I understood, he was explaining that the media was always like this and was raciallt biased as well until now. There is always some form of media that these minorities are known for or use more.
