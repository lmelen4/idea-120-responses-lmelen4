The citation of Nakumar about Lev Manovich talking about media is to be understood more deeply. He talks about race and discrimination within this topic and how the media has a lot to do with this and has changed so much within the years. Individuals that are part of minority groups like asian americans, african americans, and latinos are more part of the media today then there has ever been. From what I understood, he was explaining that the media was always like this and was racially biased as well until now. 

There is always some form of media that these minorities are known for or use more. There are many examples of a media that many people use today that is culturally race based and different many people around the world use. For example, one media that is somewhat new and is used a lot today would be "Tik-Tok". I myself have not used it or recorded myself, but I do have it to watch others and see what they do. A lot of people are comfortable using this app and defines themselves when using this app. There are other platforms of media that people use, but they are not always comfrotable. In tik tok I see people not caring about their race, where they come from, how they look, how other people may define them, etc. When he mentioned those specific groups in the reading, I realized I see a lot of African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans on this app. I mainly see them dancing because that is what I love watching and one of the things I am interested in. But, you can really see peoples identity through this app and how their mentality has changed over time.
