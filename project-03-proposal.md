My proposal or idea that I have for my non-linear narrative is something like the shows that I have watched on netlix. A non-linear is a storyline of the past, present and sometimes future about their story or something else. I am not quite sure what story I want to tell that represents a past present and/or future. I want to be able to create a game that is out of chronological order, but people understand the story or at least start to put the pieces together.
