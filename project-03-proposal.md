My proposal or idea that I have for my non-linear narrative is something like the shows that I have watched on netlix. A non-linear is a storyline of the past, present and sometimes future about their story or something else. I am not quite sure what story I want to tell that represents a past present and/or future. I want to be able to create a game that is out of chronological order, but people understand the story or at least start to put the pieces together.

I have always played games like this that are interesting and undertsanding at the end. The suspense of knowing what happens next or the rest of the story is always good. I feel like there is always something to look forwards to when playing those games especally knowing there is another piece of puzzle to put together and not knowing whats going to happen next. Although, there is always an ending to a game, it still important to intrigue the players throughout the whole game. I want to create a game that goes back to majority of our childhood with always thinking theres a monster under our bed or in our room. I want it to be like monsters inc. in a way.
